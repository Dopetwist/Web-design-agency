## Overview

I built this project with plain HTML and CSS when solidifying my frontend skills few years back.   

It's a web agency app designed with great looking user-interface. 

## Future plans

* Refine to a React web app using React + Vite and other languages/frameworks.
* Enhance the UI/UX.
* Add more functionalities.
