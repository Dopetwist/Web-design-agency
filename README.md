## Overview

I built this project with plain HTML and CSS when solidifying my frontend skills few years back.  
It's purpose is in form of a web agency that designs great looking user-interfaces which can be developed to have more functionalities.

## Future plans

To modify this project to a React web app using React + Vite and other languages/frameworks to consist of reusable components, props and manages states dynamically.
